Please explain the code and the mathematical idea behind it 

```java
  public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[][] dp = new int[coins.length+1][amount+1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= coins.length; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (j >= coins[i-1] ? dp[i][j-coins[i-1]] : 0);
            }
        }
        return dp[coins.length][amount];
    }
```

This code calculates the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a given set of coins. The input to the function is the amount to make change for, and an array of coin denominations. The function returns the number of different combinations of coins that add up to the given amount.

The approach used in the code is dynamic programming, specifically the technique of using a 2D array to store the intermediate results of subproblems. The array dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to make change for amount j using the first i coins from the array of coins.

The first row of the dp array (i.e., dp[0][j]) is initialized to 0 for j > 0, since it is not possible to make change using 0 coins. The first column of the dp array (i.e., dp[i][0]) is initialized to 1 for all i, since there is only one way to make change for an amount of 0, which is to use no coins.

The main computation is done using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the coins from the first coin to the last coin. The inner loop iterates over the amounts from 1 to the given amount. For each amount j, dp[i][j] is computed as the sum of two terms:

dp[i-1][j]: the number of ways to make change for the same amount j using only the first i-1 coins. This is the case where the i-th coin is not used.

dp[i][j-coins[i-1]]: the number of ways to make change for the remaining amount j-coins[i-1] using the first i coins. This is the case where the i-th coin is used.

The final result is stored in dp[coins.length][amount], which represents the number of ways to make change for the given amount using all the coins in the array.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(amount * coins.length), since it involves computing and storing dp[i][j] values for all i and j. The space complexity is also O(amount * coins.length), since the dp array is of that size.

can you explain about mathematical idea behind this solution? How tha final answer is showing the possible combination of coint to get that amount?
The mathematical idea behind this solution is based on the principle of dynamic programming, specifically the idea of breaking down a larger problem into smaller subproblems and reusing the solutions to those subproblems to solve the larger problem.

The problem of making change for a given amount using a given set of coins can be broken down into subproblems, where we consider the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts using a subset of the given coins. For example, to make change for an amount of 5 using coins of denominations {1, 2, 5}, we can consider the following subproblems:

Making change for 0 using {1, 2, 5}
Making change for 1 using {1, 2, 5}
Making change for 2 using {1, 2, 5}
Making change for 3 using {1, 2, 5}
Making change for 4 using {1, 2, 5}
Making change for 5 using {1, 2, 5}
The solution to each of these subproblems can be computed by considering two cases: either we use the last coin in the set or we don't use it. If we don't use the last coin, then the number of ways to make change is the same as the number of ways to make change using the remaining coins. If we do use the last coin, then the number of ways to make change is the number of ways to make change for the remaining amount using all of the coins, minus the number of ways to make change for the remaining amount using all of the coins except the last coin.

By solving these subproblems recursively, we can compute the solution to the original problem of making change for the given amount using all of the given coins. However, this approach is inefficient because it involves computing the same subproblems multiple times.

Dynamic programming avoids this redundancy by computing the solutions to the subproblems bottom-up, starting with the smallest subproblem (making change for 0) and working up to the largest subproblem (making change for the given amount using all of the given coins). Each solution to a subproblem is stored in a table (in this case, a 2D array) and reused to compute the solution to larger subproblems.

The final answer computed by the solution represents the number of different combinations of coins that add up to the given amount. Each entry in the 2D array dp[i][j] represents the number of combinations of coins that add up to the amount j, using the first i coins in the given set. The final answer is stored in dp[coins.length][amount], which represents the number of combinations of coins that add up to the given amount, using all of the coins in the given set.
